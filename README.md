# Weather-Alert-Bot
Telegram bot that sends alerts to the subsribers everyday at 7 am, depending on the weather. For instance should it rain in the next 24h, subscribers will get a "it's going to rain today. Remember to bring an umbrella" message etc etc.
The location is set to Warsaw by default, but it can be easily changed using '/setlatitude' and '/setlongitude' commands to match one's own location
